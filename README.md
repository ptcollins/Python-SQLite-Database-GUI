# Python-SQLite-Database-GUI

A complete database management system built in Python with SQLite and a graphical user interface (GUI).  
This project demonstrates database design (3NF), SQL schema implementation, data cleaning, and GUI-based data analysis — skills highly relevant to quantitative finance and data-driven problem solving.

---

## Project Overview
- Designed and implemented a **relational database** from raw CSV files (`Orders.csv`, `RestaurantInfo.csv`)
- Built an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** with Crow’s Foot notation
- Normalized the database design into **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- Created an **SQL schema** with primary and foreign keys
- Wrote **Python scripts** to:
  - Clean and preprocess raw data (handle missing values, duplicates, anomalies)
  - Populate a relational database in SQLite
  - Build **Tkinter GUIs** for:
    - Updating manager info (with email validation)
    - Calculating mean customer ratings
    - Drawing delivery time histograms

---

## Repository Structure
- `report/` – Project report (database design, data cleaning, SQL schema)
- `code/` – Jupyter notebook with Python + SQLAlchemy scripts
- `data/` – Cleaned CSVs and SQLite database
- `diagrams/` – ER diagram and GUI screenshots

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, sqlite3, SQLAlchemy, matplotlib, tkinter)
- **SQLite** relational database
- **draw.io** for ER diagrams

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Relational database design & normalization (3NF)
- SQL schema design with primary/foreign keys
- Python for database ETL pipelines
- GUI development for database interaction and statistical analysis
- Applied software engineering and documentation

 *This project was originally developed as part of an academic assignment but is presented here as a professional portfolio project to demonstrate my skills for quantitative finance internships.*
